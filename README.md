# embedding-indexed-web-search
Personal attempt to design a search engine around indexing embeddings for web pages rather than keywords. The hope is that with a descriptive enough search query, I can get higher quality web url search results. Worst case, it doesn't work, but I gain experience dealing with AI embedding models.
